"We have several people visiting the site, and we would like to track the evolution of the onboarding process across all stages.

We have three main areas:

Current Account
Savings Account
Deposits
We need to know the number of people interested in each type of product and the conversion rate for each product type."

Certainly! In addition to tracking the number of people interested in each type of product and the conversion rate for each product type, you may consider incorporating the following analysis idea:

User Journey Analysis:
Explore the user journey within each product type to understand how visitors navigate through the onboarding process. This can involve:

Path Analysis:

Identify the most common paths users take within the onboarding process for each product type. Determine if there are specific steps where users tend to deviate or drop off.
Time Spent at Each Stage:

Analyze the average time users spend at each stage of the onboarding process. Identify stages that might be causing delays or where users linger longer than usual.
Bounce Points:

Identify specific points or pages where users frequently exit the onboarding process without completing it. This can pinpoint critical areas that may need improvement.
Device and Platform Analysis:

Investigate the devices and platforms (desktop, mobile) users prefer for each product type. Ensure that the onboarding process is optimized for the most common devices.
User Feedback Integration:

Incorporate user feedback into the analysis, focusing on comments or survey responses related to the onboarding experience for each product type. This qualitative data can provide insights into user satisfaction or frustration.
Comparative Analysis Across Perimeters:

Compare the onboarding experiences across the three perimeters (Current Account, Savings Account, Deposits). Identify similarities or differences in user behavior and adjust strategies accordingly.
