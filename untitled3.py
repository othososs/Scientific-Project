Add reviews from our clients and why they chose Cetelem. This will give visitors more confidence and interest in the product.
Clients are more interested in what other clients have already done and the advantages they received. Therefore, the picture of Cetelem doesnâ€™t add any value or useful information for clients and just takes up space that could be used for something else on the page.
Add quotes depending on the season. For example, now that we are in summer, we can feature something related to summer to get clients in the mood. For example, "Save your money while enjoying your summer."
Add an open button in two places for visual effect for visitors.
Optimize the process to create an account. For example, for new customers, we can direct them to the identification page, or have another page instead of having to scroll down to select the identification page.
We cannot click on the Cetelem button on the identification page, so no one comes back.
What is the percentage of Cetelem clients who create deposit accounts compared to new visitors who choose "new client" directly? We can land directly on the plan selection page we choose if we are Cetelem clients or not.
Optimize the subscription process between client types and Cetelem plan selection.
See how to use A/B testing, for example, at abtesting.ai.
