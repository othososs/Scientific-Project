Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well. In this presentation, you will find the weekly reporting which gathers some key results, indicators, and variables from the dashboards of three sources: app, web, and landing page. The presentation consists of four slides. The first one is added to define the different key variables and the meaning of samples, as well as the objective of this reporting. The other three slides represent the results for each type of data source. The results are based on Charo's dashboards. I extracted the data in CSV format using Excel and then analyzed and presented it in PowerPoint. Please feel free to provide your feedback if there are any modifications or upgrades needed for the reporting. Thank you
