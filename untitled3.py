This code performs hyperparameter tuning for a LightGBM model using the hyperopt library. It first splits the training data into training and validation sets. Then, it defines an objective function lgbm_cv_evaluator that trains a LightGBM model with the given hyperparameters and calculates the AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) metric on the training and validation sets.
Next, it defines a search space for the LightGBM hyperparameters using the hp module from hyperopt. The fmin function from hyperopt is then used to perform the hyperparameter tuning by optimizing the AUC metric on the validation set.
After finding the best hyperparameters, the code trains a final LightGBM model with these hyperparameters.
