Hello Katarina, I hope you had a good weekend. Here is the data pass for Saving and QNH. On my side, I am testing Random Forest one last time to see if it can yield any results. After that, I will save it, and you can test it on the Test Dataset to see if it works, if it improves. Then, if you want, we can schedule a meeting in the afternoon to do a recap and see how to continue the work this week. Thank you.
