Import the required libraries: LightGBM, hyperopt, scikit-learn, numpy, pickle, fsspec, and os.
Assume that X_train and y_train are already defined and contain the training data and labels, respectively.
Split the training data (X_train and y_train) into smaller training and validation sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. In this case, 20% of the data is used for validation, and a fixed random state of 42 is used for reproducibility.
Initialize a global variable global_iteration to keep track of the number of iterations in the optimization process.
Define a function lgbm_cv_evaluator that will be used by hyperopt to evaluate different sets of hyperparameters for the LightGBM model.

This function creates LightGBM datasets for training and validation using the provided hyperparameters.
It sets additional hyperparameters for the LightGBM model (objective, metric, verbose).
It trains a LightGBM model with the given hyperparameters, using early stopping and validation monitoring.
It calculates the AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) scores for both the training and validation sets.
It prints information about the current iteration, including the train and validation AUC scores and the hyperparameters used.
It returns a dictionary containing the negative validation AUC (since hyperopt minimizes the loss function), a status indicating a successful evaluation, and the hyperparameters used.


Define the search space for the hyperparameter optimization process using the hp module from hyperopt. This specifies the range or distribution of values to be explored for each hyperparameter of the LightGBM model.
Initialize a Trials object to store the results of the optimization process.
Call fmin from hyperopt to perform the hyperparameter optimization. This function takes the following arguments:

fn=lgbm_cv_evaluator: The objective function to be minimized.
space: The dictionary defining the hyperparameter search space.
algo=tpe.suggest: The algorithm for suggesting new hyperparameters (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator).
max_evals=50: The maximum number of evaluations to perform.
trials: The Trials object to store the results.


After the optimization process, retrieve the best set of hyperparameters found (best_params) from the trials object.
Train a final LightGBM model using the best hyperparameters (best_params) on the entire training set (X_train_split and y_train_split), with additional settings for the number of boosting rounds, early stopping, and validation monitoring.
Define the path_saving variable with the desired cloud directory path for saving the model and hyperparameters.
Open a file in the specified cloud directory using fsspec.open and save the trained LightGBM model to this file using pickle.dump.
Open another file in the specified cloud directory using fsspec.open and save the best hyperparameters (best_params) to this file using pickle.dump.
