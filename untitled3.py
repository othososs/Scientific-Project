Hello,

I finished the top exit page file and imported it into Power BI. It works, but we can't see the entire URL link. If you have time, could you please take a look to see if there's a way to optimize the space on the dashboard? Additionally, there's another issue: when we don't choose any filters, instead of getting all results, we get another result.
