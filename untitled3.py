For BD, the team in Spain approved the proposed version, which is good. They just had one remark to add the absolute values with percentages in the email.
I already have the report, and I think I'll send it this afternoon since everything is automated on Adobe.

For the BTL campaign, the last model I developed and tested did not yield good results. However, we launched a model last Friday, and it has finished training. Catarina might be able to get results today.

For the AB test, before starting my research, I analyzed the site and found a few important remarks. I don't know if this is relevant for you, but the web page loading speeds (LCP and FCP) are very high, outside the normal range.
